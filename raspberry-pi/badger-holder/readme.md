# Badger Holder

The Pimoroni Badger2040 is fantastic, so I had to instantly order one. This was a design for a case that would mount the badger, a small LiPo battery and hold my office ID/pass card on the back.

I've now ordered a Badger2040W, and a smaller battery with a plastic shell, so need to revisit this and include some learnings - like the buttons are extremely fragile!
