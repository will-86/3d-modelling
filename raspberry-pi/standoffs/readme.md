# Stand-Offs

A really simple design for a stand-off to space a Pi & HAT. Mainly used with Pi Zero and pHATs, as a lot of the kits I've gotten over the years just use the GPIO header as the mounting point, and I've wanted to make something a bit more... _secure_ that also puts a lot less pressure on the header itself.
