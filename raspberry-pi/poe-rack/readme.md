# Rasberry Pi Rack

I finally got around to ordering the PoE HAT for some of my Raspberry Pi 4's, and decided that I'd rather have them in a simple rack-like holder then as a bunch of Pibow's lying all over the shelf in the server cupboard. This is not a great design, but it was something I could create and print quickly.
