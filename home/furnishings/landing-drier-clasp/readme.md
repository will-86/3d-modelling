# Landing Drier Clasp

My wife wanted to use cloth nappies for both kids, so this means that the washing machine is in use _a lot_. We don't have space for a tumble dryer in the utility room, so instead we have a pair of driers that are meant to hang from a radiator, but since this is not good for the nappies, we instead wanted to hang them from the landing banister over the stairs. These clasps hook onto the banister and provide some purchase for the drier hooks.

And yes, I have no idea how to spell dryer/drier.
