# Sofa Arm Rest

This was a quick and dirty design for a simple tray to mount on to the arm rests of the new sofa. Turns out PLA is not a great material for this, but has held up much better than I expected. They have both warped _significantly_ though, as I designed them to be a snug friction fit, but they've just been bent outwards.
