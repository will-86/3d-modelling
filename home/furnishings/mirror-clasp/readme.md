# Mirror Clasp

Simple attachment point for hanging a homepod mini on the side of my wife's dressing table mirror. It was a very quick job, didn't serve it's purpose well as the homepod kept falling off, but just about did good enough until we re-arranged the room and I could move the hompod on to a bedside table.
