# Desk Lamp

The aim of this model is to create a holder/shade for attaching an extra hue bulb I have to the top of my monitor stand/arm/mount. Not yet decided if I want a backlight-type thing for video calls, or a down-lighter for desk work. The bulb and wiring assembly has already been done using bits and bobs from B&Q.
